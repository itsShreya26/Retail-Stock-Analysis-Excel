I analyzed a fashion retail dataset using Excel Pivot Tables to identify which product categories had the highest available stock.

The Kurta category had the highest stock at 114,333 units, followed by Kurta Set with 47,882 units, and Top with 16,608 units.

Categories like Jumpsuit, Cardigan, and Bottom had very low inventory, indicating either low demand or limited supply.

I visualized the stock distribution using a PivotChart for easier comparison."
